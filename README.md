# elevenlabs-ui

A [streamlit app](https://elevenlabs-dialogue.streamlit.app/) that allows you create dialogues between characters using ElevenLabs. The tool also gives you the option to edit aspects of the audio and generate plots and dialogues using OpenAI (optional).

### TODO

- [x] Add water and engine sound effects.
- [x] Ability to upload your own sound effects.
- [x] Add trim, extend, fade in, and fade out options to dialogue line editing.
- [x] No instructions mode (for advanced users)
- [ ] Ability to upload your own background sounds.
- [ ] Allow for the dialogue line start time to vary independently (gaps or really talking over each other?).
- [ ] Place characters into a common room (volume, reverb, and background).
- [ ] Allow the loading of complete projects (just like dialogue)
- [ ] Allow applying each audio effect in form so it clears; also better to preview and apply each
- [ ] Quick selections for reverb, compression, or other common settings
