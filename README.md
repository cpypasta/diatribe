# elevenlabs-ui

A [streamlit app](https://elevenlabs-dialogue.streamlit.app/) that allows you create dialogues between characters using ElevenLabs. The tool also gives you the option to edit aspects of the audio and generate plots and dialogues using OpenAI (optional).

### TODO

- [ ] Add water and engine sound effects.
- [ ] Allow for the dialogue line start time to vary independently (gaps or really talking over each other?).
- [ ] Place characters into a common room (volume, reverb, and background).
- [ ] Add dialogue lines that are just background.
- [ ] Add trim, extend, fade in, fade out, options to dialogue line editing.
