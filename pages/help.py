    Diatribe is a tool to create interesting audio dialogues. Diatribe is mostly a wrapper around ElevenLabs.
    ElevenLabs has a `projects` feature, but I found it lacking for what I wanted to do.

st.markdown("""
    The motivation for creating Diatribe was to create a tool for my family. We were haing so much
    fun with the cloned voices. At first, I created everything in ElevenLabs and combined and edited
    the dialogue lines in a desktop audio editor. But as family demand for more dialogues continued to grow and
    being the lazy programmer that I am, I decided to create a tool to automate the process. The name `Diatribe`
    was given since the dialogues created tended to be silly and long-winded.
