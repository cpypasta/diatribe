# PLOT
Nick and Alyssa are brother and sister. One night, Nick decides to tease Alyssa by daring her to take a walk through the woods. They live in Louisiana, and the night is rather warm, and the woods are bustling with activity. While most nights are unimportant, this night is not one of them.

# DIALOGUE
Nick: So you are so tough, you will walk through the woods?
Alyssa: Yes, I will. You think just because I'm a girl I will not? First of all, you aren't so tough yourself. Second of all, there is a reason why most people don't walk in the woods at night. It's stupid. That being said, you can go suck it, and I'll show you.
Nick: Haha! You are such a liar. You are all talk.
Alyssa: I tell you what. I'll walk through the woods if you do too. What do you say?
Nick: Oh you need your big brother to protect you? I'm not afraid. I'll do it.
Alyssa: Cool. Let's go then.
Nick: Sounds good.
Alyssa: I'm bringing a flashlight though, since I'm not an idiot.
Nick: Whatever. Neither of us can see in the dark. And I don't want to hear any excuses.
Narrator: Nick and Alyssa make their way to the woods. Like many homes in Louisiana, the woods are only a stones throw away from their house. Alyssa grabs the flashlight and Nick continues to tease her. Not long after, they make it to the edge of the woods.
Alyssa: You do realize daring people is a child's game? I'm not scared, but I'm just saying you are an idiot.
Nick: I'm definitely not scared. These woods are the same woods we see during the day. It is only because it is night that people like you fear them.
Alyssa: You sound like a naive child. Dark woods are not just scary because of there being no light. There are animals and creatures that only come out at night. Humans are usually not one of them. Perhaps there is a reason for that?
Nick: Bullshit. It's because people like you don't have the mental discipline like I do. I know these woods are the same as during the day, and I'm not going to let my imagination get the better of me.
Narrator: They make their way farther and farther into the woods. Nick flaunts his masculine fearlessness. Alyssa is both listening to her brother babble on about how he is such a stud, while also keeping her eyes and ears on her surroundings.
Nick: This is fun, right?
Alyssa: I'm fine. You just let me know when you are ready to head back.
Nick: Like that will ever happen.
Alyssa: You do realize we also have to walk back, right?
Nick: Aww, are you saying you are ready to turn back?
Alyssa: Okay, you play the tough guy. We'll see who wants to turn back first.
Nick: I'm fine. I'm having a blast out here. You just.... what was that? Did you hear that?
Alyssa: I did. Shut up. Be quiet.
Narrator: Alyssa and Nick both stop and get low to the ground, Alyssa turning off her flashlight. There is a murmor that can be heard in the night sky and there is a brief flash of lights that appear on the treeline to the south of their location.
Alyssa: What was that? Did you see those lights?
Nick: I did. It didn't look like a flashlight though. I'm not sure what it is...
Alyssa: Let's turn back. I don't like this.
Nick: Okay. Let's try to go back the way we came.
Alyssa: How are we going to see our way back? Should I turn on my flashlight?
Nick: Let's try without it at first.  I'm not sure what that noise was, but I don't want to draw any attention.
Alyssa: Okay. Let's go.
Narrator: They try to find their way through the woods, but it is not easy. And the light they saw earlier is getting brighter. It helps them see their way, but they aren't sure where it is coming from.
Alyssa: That light is getting brighter. I don't like this. This isn't normal Nick. Something weird is going on.
Nick: I agree. Fuck this. Let's get the hell out of here.
Narrator: This is the end of part one. Stay tuned to find what fate holds for Nick and Alyssa. What will happen next?
